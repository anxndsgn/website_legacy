            <p>
              As a human interface designer, I am interested in design
              engineering, design ops and design systems, which I call{" "}
              {'"Design for Development (DfD)"'}.
            </p>
            <p>
              And I have always made natural, intuitive design my first
              principle, and, of course, with good looks.

            {/* <p>
              The word design to me represents the purposeful creation of human
              beings, which can be as small as looking good and communicating
              information better, or as large as developing a system or a set of
              rules.
